# Search-Engine
Natural Language Processing

- In this project I implemented and evaluated a ranked search engine.

- The goal is to return a ranked list of relevant documents for each query from the text documents. Following
that, the Mean Average Precision was calculated, where the reference or gold standard is
obtained from the relevance judgments.

- To run the code correctly, you must unzip the zipped file and put cranqrel file, docs and query folders in teh same directory as the python file directory.
